# Problem Analysis
The program generates various patterns based on user input, using loops for different designs.

## Inputs
-input: The user is prompted to select a pattern from a menu (numbered 1-9).
-Output: Based on the user's choice, the program outputs one of the pre-defined patterns. If the user selects an invalid option, the program should prompt the user to try again. If the user selects option 9, the program exits

## Operation
1. Pattern 1 prints numbers starting from 5 and decreases for each row.
2.Pattern 2 prints alphabet letters in increasing order.
3.Pattern 3 prints lowercase alphabet letters for 5 rows.
4.Pattern 4 prints a hollow square, with stars on the border.
5.Pattern 5 prints a diagonal of stars in a triangular shape.
6.Pattern 6 prints a right-aligned triangle of stars.
7.Pattern 7 prints a left-aligned triangle of stars.
8.Pattern 8 prints a hollow right-angle triangle with stars along the edges.
9.Pattern 9 Centered pyramid with decreasing rows.
10. pattern 10 Pyramid with stars only at edges and base.
11. pattern 11 Similar to the hollow pyramid but inverted.

## Outputs
The program outputs the selected pattern.

# Pseudo Code
step 1. START
step 2. Prompt user for rows and columns.
step 3. Prompt user to choose a pattern (1-14).
step 4. Use a SWITCH statement for the selected pattern:
    - Pattern 1:
 Use two nested loops. The outer loop handles the number of rows, and the inner loop handles the numbers printed in each row, starting from 5 and decreasing.

Pattern 2:
Use two nested loops. The outer loop handles the number of rows, and the inner loop prints characters (alphabet) in increasing order.

Pattern 3:
Similar to Pattern 2, but the characters are lowercase letters, and all rows print the same set of characters from a to e.

Pattern 4:
A square grid of stars with hollow spaces. Use conditions to print stars on the borders and spaces inside.

Pattern 5:
Print stars along the diagonal in a decreasing pattern using nested loops and conditions for positioning the stars.

Pattern 6:
 Print stars in a right-aligned triangle by adjusting spaces before the stars.

Pattern 7:
Print stars in a left-aligned triangle, adjusting spaces before the stars, but in reverse (starting with 6 stars in the first row).

Pattern 8:
 Print stars in a hollow right-angle triangle, with stars at the borders of the triangle and spaces inside.
step 5. END
