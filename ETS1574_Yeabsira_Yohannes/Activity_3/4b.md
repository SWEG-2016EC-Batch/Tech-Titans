# Problem Analysis
The program generates various patterns based on user input, using loops for different designs.

## Inputs
-input: The user is prompted to select a pattern from a menu (numbered 1-9).
-Output: Based on the user's choice, the program outputs one of the pre-defined patterns. If the user selects an invalid option, the program should prompt the user to try again. If the user selects option 9, the program exits

## Operation
1. **Rectangle of Stars**: Print a rectangle of stars using nested loops.
2. **Square of Stars**: Same as the rectangle, assuming rows = columns.
3. **Half Pyramid of Stars**: Incremental rows of stars.
4. **Half Pyramid of Numbers**: Incremental rows of numbers.
5. **Inverted Half Pyramid of Stars**: Decreasing stars in each row.
6. **Half Pyramid of Alphabets**: Incremental rows of alphabets.
7. **Inverted Half Pyramid of Alphabets**: Decreasing rows of alphabets.
8. **Full Pyramid of Stars**: Centered pyramid of stars.
9. **Inverted Full Pyramid of Stars**: Centered pyramid with decreasing rows.
10. **Hollow Full Pyramid of Stars**: Pyramid with stars only at edges and base.
11. **Inverted Hollow Full Pyramid of Stars**: Similar to the hollow pyramid but inverted.
12. **Custom Pattern**: Placeholder for user-defined patterns.
13. **Pattern of Numbers**: Rectangular grid of numbers.
14. **Pattern of Alphabets**: Rectangular grid of alphabets, looping after 'Z'.

## Outputs
The program outputs the selected pattern.

# Pseudo Code
step 1. START
step 2. Prompt user for rows and columns.
step 3. Prompt user to choose a pattern (1-14).
step 4. Use a SWITCH statement for the selected pattern:
    - **Case 1**: Rectangle of Stars
    - **Case 2**: Square of Stars
    - **Case 3**: Half Pyramid of Stars
    - **Case 4**: Half Pyramid of Numbers
    - **Case 5**: Inverted Half Pyramid of Stars
    - **Case 6**: Half Pyramid of Alphabets
    - **Case 7**: Inverted Half Pyramid of Alphabets
    - **Case 8**: Full Pyramid of Stars
    - **Case 9**: Inverted Full Pyramid of Stars
    - **Case 10**: Hollow Full Pyramid of Stars
    - **Case 11**: Inverted Hollow Full Pyramid of Stars
    - **Default**: Invalid choice.
step 5. END
